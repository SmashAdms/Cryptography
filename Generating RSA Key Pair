##generate an RSA keypair through the following steps.
Create a 2048 bit RSA private/public keypair with:
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
#Extract the public key from this keypair with:
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
catpublic.pem
#ensure the file says BEGIN PUBLIC KEY at the top, and END PUBLIC KEY at the bottom.
#Rename your partner's public key to: partners_public.pem
#After renaming partner's key, move it into ~/Documents/HybridCryptosystems
